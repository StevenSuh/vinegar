Sort of a wish list

engineering:
- Unit tests
  - Most likely Jest
- Clean up a lot of code - create utilities, refactor repeated logic (focus socket, interval)
- Separate socket out of api to a different service/container
- Note that Sequelize.INTEGER hits a limit at around 2 billion. Consider using BIGINT data type for Id primary key.
- Normalizing data schemas (requests, sockets, db, redis) to simpler convention (specifically, dates have been hard to deal with - time in ms vs. date string?)
- Use redis as R/W cache in between interacting with DB for socket (optimization task, to be housed in /shared/db)

product:
- add send button to chat (use arrow)
- add upvote downvote feature
- add tooltips to owner/interval icons

bugs:
