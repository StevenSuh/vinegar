Sort of a wish list
In the order of importance ASC -> DESC

engineering:
1. Use node-schedule for `interval` worker - done
2. Unit tests
3. Clean up a lot of code - create utilities, refactor repeated logic (focus socket, interval)
4. Separate socket out of api
5. Note that Sequelize.INTEGER hits a limit at around 2 billion. Consider using BIGINT data type for Id primary key.
6. Look into adding logging for deployment. So far, I've found Stackdriver logging for GCP.
7. Rate limiting through express-rate-limit (needs manual limiting for socket connections)

product:
1. If kicked out 3 times, block the user's ip address from session
