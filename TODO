Sort of a wish list
In the order of importance ASC -> DESC

engineering:
1. Use node-schedule for `interval` worker
2. Unit tests
3. Clean up a lot of code - create utilities, refactor repeated logic (focus socket, interval)
4. Separate socket out of api

product:
1. If kicked out 3 times, block the user's ip address from session
